## 4.1. Encrypt and Decrypt Text file
1. Create a text file named plain.txt:
2. Encrypt and decrypt plain.txt using AES-256 in ECB mode:

ìn

3. Encrypt and decrypt plain.txt using AES-256 in CBC mode:

hình

## 4.2 Encryption Mode – ECB vs. CBC
1. Split the file into header and body:
   hịnh
2. Encrypt the body using AES-256 in CBC mode and combine the header and encrypted body:
   hình
3. This is the encrypted picture
   hình
## 4.3 Encryption Mode – Corrupted Cipher Text
